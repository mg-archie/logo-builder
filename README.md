# Logo Builder

## Description

  I was motivated to provide a streamlined command line application for logo generation.  For the functions in this app to be tested for accuracy.  It solves a problem of convenience.  If you want a quick, custom logo generation this is for you.  I learnt how to implement class constructors in practical framwork.  I also learned to test these constructors and related functions. 

## Usage

Using the command line users can select three characters of text, text colour, logo shape and logo colour to render to an SVG file.  That file can then be opened in the browser to display the logo.

## Credits

Andres Jiminez (tutor) helped me navigate the best way to test the rendering of the shapes based on the way I had them structured. 

## Tests

Three tests can be run, one for square, circle and triangle.  Each test is ran using "npm run test" in the node.js command line to see if the the user's choices for logo renders correctly for each shape.
